Relishiq Developer Technical Test - Daniel Juarez

The application is deployed to an EC2 Instance using docker compose. http://ec2-44-203-86-119.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000
It's a free account so if the URL change and you couldn't enter please let me know and I'll check it out.

The CI/CD pipeline it's not at a 100%, I couldn't make it work as it should, but you can see the configuration and how i was trying to do it. It was my first experience with a CI/CD pipeline but I'm sure that I'll learn more about it in the next days, even if I'm not selected.

To make work the application localy you just need to clone the repository and make an npm install on each project (backend and frontend)
